# Advanced Dynamics - Design Your Own Experiment

You should add the following to this repository:

* `Project Overview.ipynb` (notebook corresponding to the project overview, deliverable A)
* An additional `ipynb` Colab notebook (which will hold all other parts of the experiment). This notebook should have a title that reflects what your experiment is about.
* Data files (as appropriate)
